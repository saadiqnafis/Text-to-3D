# Text-to-3D

I worked with my friends Cathy and Michael for developing this Text to 3D AI model. Out model will take the textual form of our ideas as input and generate a 3D model on the basis of that.

# Inspiration:
First of all, 3D designing is a really complex process. Unlike 2D designing which can be as simple as drawing on a canvas, it requires much effort for adopting 3d modelling skills, so the learning curve is quite steep. 

Secondly, most 3D designing softwares come with a very high cost. They have expensive subscription plans and these are not suitable for everyone.

Moreover, for 3D designing, computers with advanced hardwares are required, and without such advanced hardwares, the designing software will lag quite often.

Designing is often an iterative process, and as 3D modelling is a complex process, it requires enormous time to come up with a fruitful model. For these reasons, we decided to build an AI model that can generate 3D models based on commands
